# dev-rigor-stack installer (Windows PowerShell / PowerShell 7+).
# Copies the vendored skills into your agent's skills directory, and (for a default Claude
# install) also installs the always-on dev-rigor reflex hook and wires it into settings.json.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.ps1                                  # -> $env:CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR\skills or ~\.claude\skills
#   ./install.ps1 -Target ~/.codex/skills          # install skills elsewhere (e.g. Codex); no reflex hook
#
# Requires Node.js for the reflex hook (the six skills install without it). On a locked-down
# box, run this as:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
#
# Re-running updates in place (each skill is replaced; the hook re-wires idempotently). No path assumptions.
# NOTE: kept ASCII-only on purpose -- Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less script as
# ANSI, so non-ASCII characters (em dashes, smart quotes) would break the parser.

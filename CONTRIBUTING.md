# Contributing

Thanks for considering it. This repo practices what it ships — contributions walk the
same gates the stack enforces.

## Ground rules

- **Every change comes with its check.** Hook changes need a test in
  `plugin/hooks/test-hooks.js` that fails without the change (watch it fail first).
  Doc changes must not overclaim — if you say the product does X, the code must do X.
- **Run the suite before pushing:** `node plugin/hooks/test-hooks.js` (41 hermetic
  tests, no framework, no network). CI runs it on Ubuntu and Windows plus a sync-block
  check (`python3 tools/check_sync.py`) and byte-parity of the two export scripts.
- **Green-path only.** PRs merge when CI is green. No `--admin`, no overrides.
- **Windows PowerShell 5.1 is a first-class target.** `.ps1` files stay pure ASCII
  (PS 5.1 reads BOM-less files as ANSI — non-ASCII in source breaks or corrupts);
  build non-ASCII output via `[char]0x2014`-style code points. All file reads specify
  UTF-8 explicitly.
- **The installers are hand-kept in sync** (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`): a behavior
  change lands in both, and both get re-verified.
- **Skills must not contradict the stack's hard rules** (Workflow-tool fan-out, never
  merge red, never self-review, host-agnostic completion gates). CI's integrity tests
  and periodic sweeps enforce some of this; reviewers enforce the rest.

## Practical notes

- Zero runtime dependencies is deliberate — the hooks use only Node built-ins. Don't
  add a package.json for the product (dev tooling included).
- Keep `SKILL.md` / `SKILL-LITE.md` sync blocks byte-identical (`lite:required`) or
  absent (`lite:excluded`); `tools/check_sync.py` gates this.
- Prose style: honest, specific, no theater. The receipt format is
  `proved: <check + result> · blast: <level> · skipped: <gate + why>`.

## Reporting bugs

Open a GitHub issue with the narrowest reproduction you have — the command you ran and
its verbatim output beat a description of both. For security issues, see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
